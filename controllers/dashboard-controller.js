 * 
 * This controller is responsible for:
 * 1. Displaying the dashboard view which contains a list of all weather stations aded by the loggied in user.
 * 2. Collecting and processing data for each station, including weather reports, maximum and minimum values for fields, and latest information.
 * 3. Rendering the summary of each station.
 * 4. Allowing users to add new stations and delete existing stations from their dashboard.
 * 
 * The controller uses the stationStore and the reportStore to manage stations and weather reports.
 * It gathers all relevant data and passes it to the dashboard-view for rendering.
